proteinGroups.txt prep

Open Excel with blank sheet
Use menues or other mechanism in Excel to open proteinGroups.txt file
	We want the Text Import Wizard to activate
	Click "next" on first two steps (delimited and tab as separator)
	In third step, make sure any columns with gene names are text format (7th column)
After import, save file as XLSX format (and name something more distinct)
Add a spacer column at the far right of the sheet (Col. CV) and fill with "blank"
Add a "flag" column to denote rejected proteins (decoys, contams, missing data)
Populate the "flag" column with "z" (later we will sort descending)
Add 4 extra rows at top of sheet (so headers are in Row 5)
Make header row "bold"
Allow header cells to wrap text (cell formatting)
Save sheet (save often)

Select Row 5 and turn on column filters
Show "+" for Col CK ("Reverse") to show decoys
Replace "z" in Flag column (CW) with "decoy" and fill down
Reset column filter on CK
Show "+" for Col CL ("Potential contaminant") to show contaminants
Replace "z" in Flag column (CW) with "contam" and fill down
Reset column filter on CL
Show any rows with "keratin" in "Protein names" (Col F)
Flag any additional keratins as "contams" in Flag column
Look for "albumin" and also flag as contam
Clear filter on Col. F

Sort descending on Flag column (CW)
Insert blank row at bottom of table between contams and decoys and other proteins
Select Row 5 and turn off column filters
Locate the reporter ion columns of interest and add sample key in Row 4 above
	Do not use and "corrected" reporter ion columns
	There are experiment-wide columns (Cols X-BA)
	There are columns for each experimental sample (cols BB-CE)
	We want columns BL through BU
	Add sample key above reporter channels (they are in increasing mass order)
		Sample key is in file KUR1502_sample_key.xlxs (cells D4:D13)
			Paste special with "transpose" checked
		Note that N forms are lighter than C forms
		An alphabetical ordering is not the same as a mass-based ordering
		
[sheet KUR1502_proteinGroups_int1.xlxs is work up to this point]

We need to get columns for the same condition together for counting of missing data
Copy the three media columns (BL, BQ, and BU) to columns CY, CZ, and DA
	I skipped the contam/decoy rows (greater than 5130)
Copy the 4 exosome columns (BN, BP, BR, and BT) to DB:DE
Replace the column names (row 5) with sample names
Label column CX "missing"
Fill CX with this formula:
	=IF( OR(COUNTIF(CY6:DA6, ">1") >= 2, COUNTIF(DB6:DE6, ">1") >= 3 ), "ok", "skip")
	In these discovery experiments, we want to cast a wide net
	We want to allow a maximum of one missed reporter ion in EITHER condition
Select Row 5 and turn column filters back on
Show rows with "skip" in Col. CX
Replace "z" in Flag column (CW) with "missing data"
Clear filter on Col. CX
Sort descending on FLag column (CW) to move missing data rows to bottom of table
Insert a blank row after the "good" data (after row 4869)

Copy cells B5:B4870 (Majority protein IDs) to cells DF5:DF4869
Rename column header to "Accession" (cell DF5)
[Optional:
	Convert text-to-columns as delimited with semicolon checked
	Select a bunch of columns (eg. DG to DZ) and clear contents]
Add a new tab
Rename tab to "MQ_prepped_data"
Copy cells CY5:DF4869 to new tab (paste in at cell A1)
Save workbook [a KUR1502_protenGroups_int2 file was created here]
Go to "MQ_prepped_data" tab
Save As "MQ_prepped_data.csv" in CSV format (save just the selected tab)
Excel may give you several warnings
Quit Excel

Zero replacements and data normalizations will be done in R
